# Jacob's Light Server

This is a simple webapp I run on a Raspberry Pi to control [my LIFX lights](https://www.lifx.com/products/lifx-color-a19) in my room.

It's tailored to my specific use-case (or, it will be), but it should be easy enough to modify for your own needs. And if you'd like to expand on it and submit a PR, I'd be open to collab :)

## Installation

These are the steps for installing on a Raspberry Pi, although they should translate fairly well to any other Python-running platform

Install python3
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```
Install Flask
```
sudo pip3 install flask
```
Install [lifxlan](https://github.com/mclarkk/lifxlan)
```
git clone https://github.com/mclarkk/lifxlan.git
cd lifxlan
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
Clone and run this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jacobwhall/light-control.git
cd light-control
sudo ./web.py
```
I'll add instructions for daemonizing this soon!

## Thanks

A huge thanks to @mclarkk and the other contributors to [lifxlan](https://github.com/mclarkk/lifxlan). Their library has been so easy to work with.

Thanks to @[Elijah1111](https://github.com/Elijah1111) for introducing me to the wonders of Flask. This project began by stealing some of his work, hopefully he'll forgive me.

Thanks to the people who made Flask, whoever they are!
